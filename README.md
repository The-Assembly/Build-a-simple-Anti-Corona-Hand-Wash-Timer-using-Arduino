# Build-a-simple-Anti-Corona-Hand-Wash-Timer-using-Arduino
In this online workshop, we'll show you how to quickly build a simple DIY Handwash Timer - an item that is very useful to prevent the risk of contracting Coronavirus given the prevailing situation! Our device will use an HC-SR04 Ultrasound Sensor and some LEDs to make sure that the user rubs soap on his hands for at least 20 seconds. This timer will detect a person washing hands and will signal using LEDs that the hands need to be washed for 20 seconds. After 20 seconds, an alarm will sound along with a green light indicating the passage of 20s and the fact that most of the germs are killed. All parts can be easily purchased online at a very minimal cost.
